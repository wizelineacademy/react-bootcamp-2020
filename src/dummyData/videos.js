        title: 'Where Boba Fett Has Been Since Return of the Jedi',
        description:
          "Subscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR\n\nBoba Fett is back and has made his grand return in the Season Two Premiere on Disney +’s, The Mandalorian! I bet you're asking how is Boba Fett alive? The last time we saw Jango’s clone was in “The Return of the Jedi” tumbling down into the Sarlacc Pit. No spoilers here, but after you watch the video you’ll have your answer to how Boba escapes the Sarlacc not once, but twice.\n\nGreat! So now that Boba has returned to the screen the new question to ask is what’s he been up to for the last five years? Well in Canon, we don’t have that answer unfortunately. We have some clues from the book, “Star Wars: Aftermath” but it’s not definitive. Disney has stayed pretty quiet on the subject so to answer this question we need to dive into the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Here, we have plenty of information on Boba Fett and how he’s kept himself busy which is what we’re going to look at in today's CBR video! \n\nThe Star Wars EU has already weaseled its head back into Star Wars Canon. A prime example of this is Palpatine's return which came from the “Dark Empire” six issue comic. So, with the Star Wars EU we can learn of Boba’s journey since escaping the Sarlacc and adapt it to what we know in Canon creating our own Star Wars theory. So, if you're ready to venture into his galaxy far far away, strap into your jetpacks because the video starts now! \n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/CBR\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ComicBookRes...\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cbrvideo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/comi...\n\nOur Website\nhttps://www.cbr.com\n\nWritten by: Yasin Muhammad \nNarrated by: Justin Freitas\nEdited by: Milos Licina\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",

        title: "Top 10 Interesting Facts About Jango Fett (Boba Fett's Dad)",
        description:
          "Jango Fett, the man who created Boba Fett and the rest of the Clones.\nJango has a deep connection to Death Watch, not as a member, but as a rival. Jango, in the Clone Wars wasn't recognized as a true Mandalorian, at least, not that Almec knew of, so it leads me to wonder if that will be developed by Boba Fett in The Mandalorian Season 2. \n\nNot only was Jango Fett the template for the Clones, hired by Count Dooku, but he was also the best Bounty Hunter in the galaxy, known to have defeated many Jedi. \n\nHere are 10 very important facts about Boba Fett, Mandalorians, Death Watch and Bounty Hunters all revolving around the Clone Trooper's template originator; Jango Fett.\n\nI hope you'll all join me in this week's The Mandalorian Season 2 episode watch party and the breakdown, I can't wait to hopefully see Ahsoka and learn more about the Dark Saber...maybe even see Luke Skywalker taking care of Baby Yoda at some point? Possible?\nWill Boba Fett team up with The Mandalorian Din Djarin? Or will they fight?!\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",

        description:
          "Karthon chop fields as we see prison inmates serving time by dissasembling imperial machines, namely, tie fighters, as we even see ATAT’s repurposed in the background as cranes.\n As the \nAs the droid walks up to Mayfeld, he tells him to salute Marshall dune, where she remands him in her custody. As they walk around the corner, they meet up with the crew, as we see the beautiful Slave 1, and of course Boba Fett, who repainted his rusted up armour. I like the look, it looks like he’s going for some batman matte green vibes. I love it.\n\nAs they head to Morak, Boba tells us that Morak is mining Rhydonium\n\nNow you might not remember, by rhydonium was used by sabine and Hera to kill fyrnocks on annexes, the old abandoned republic base that we saw Anakin obi-wan rex and the rest of the troopers at during clone wars season 7.\n\nMando and Mayfeld get in the trooper suits, as we all know, he can’t show his face as part of his creed from death watch. Now Death Watch changed their rules after order 66 to reserve their identity and numbers, since the empire were against them, that’s my theory at least, until we know more for sure.\n\nAs Mando and Mayfeld head inside to stormtroopers celebrating, they head for a terminal. \n\nFennec and Cara stand guard outside, aim down their sights.\n\nAs Mando and Mayfeld sith for drinks with the commander for drinks, Mayfeld says they should toast to operation cinder. Now operation cinder is a reference to when we learned about that during battlefront 2 campaign. Operation cinder was part of palpatine’s contingency plan to be carried out should he ever die. It was essentially that the empire’s enemies shouldn’t survive if he didn’t. So they set up massive satellites above planets and fired red lasers to mess around with the planet’s weather, basically causing Mother Nature on every planet to go absolutely insane and destroy itself in a blaze of fire and storm. Valin Hess says wow you know your history, when he says he was there during burnin konn, which was one of the planets they executed operation cinder upon. The people who died were around 5-10000, including many imperial troops. Valin Hess approved operation cinder on the planet, and you can tell Mayfeld is hit with some PTSD. Bill Burr at this point is giving an incredible performance man I gotta say, they guy did his homework for sure. As Valin Hess defends his actions of murder, he talks about how he made decisions to be where they are today, and the rhydonium that they just delivered, will make burnin konn look like nothing. \nTo the empire, Hess says as he raises his glass, only to be blasted in the chest by Mayfeld a second later. The two shoot their way out of there, heading onto the ledge as Cara and Fennec offer sniper support ontop of the hill.\n\nBoba flies in and the boys head up to the ship as they leap into it while blasting troopers all around them. Mayfeld snipes the rhydonium far away and blows up the whole compound. \nAs Boba escapes, two tie-fighters head straight for him, when he releases a seismic charge, which is the best sound in Star Wars. Shout out to all my prequelers who saw episode 2 in the theatre where we all lost some hearing when Jango dropped a couple of those on Kenobi in the asteroid field. Like music to my audio receptors. \n\nThey meet up with fennec and cara, as they let Mayfeld go for a job well done. Claiming he died in the base’s destruction. Mayfeld probably gets off the planet somehow, and maybe we’ll see him again someday.\n\nMando tells Cara he has the coordinates for Moff Gideon, and the slave one blasts off with that beautiful iconic blast off into the sky. We enter moff Gideon’s light cruiser as his officer informs him of a message and pops Mando’s hologram up on the desk. Mando recites the exact same lines Moff Gideon tells him in Season 1 episode 7, the same episode number as this one. Mof Gideon, you have something I want. You may think you have some idea of what you’re in possession of. But you do not. Soon, he will be back with me. He means more to me than you will ever know. \n\nNext week is the season finale, I can't wait to see Moff Gideon fight Mando or Bo or Ahsoka with the Dark Saber. I want to see Boba Fett fight the Dark Troopers.\n\nBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",

        description:
          "Star Wars' Beskar VS The MCU's Adamantium And Vibranium\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR\n\nIs there anything fans love more than debates about random aspects of fictional universes? That’s a trick question because we all know the answer is a resounding no. While we’ve had many fights where we pitted heroes against heroes, we will now determine which is the greatest metal in the pop culture universe. We’ve managed to narrow everything down to three of the most popular in fandom history. Those would be Beskar from the Star Wars universe, as popularized by The Mandalorian, Vibranium from the MCU as popularized by Black Panther and the Captain America films and Adamantium from the X-Men series as popularized by every single time Wolverine had a rampage.\n\nAs far as Beskar is concerned, we’ll cover what may be the most sought after metal in the Star Wars universe. The Mandalorian has gone to great lengths to show not only the physical value of Beskar but the spiritual value it has to Mandalorians as well.\n\nThen we’ll cover Vibranium, the signature weapon of Wakandans and Captain America. This incredibly versatile metal from a meteor that dropped on Africa changed Wakanda and the world forever. Until Thanos showed that it wasn’t quite as powerful as we thought.\n\nFinally, we’ll cover Adamantium from the old X-Men film series. It may have been awesome when Wolverine used it, but how much do we count off for that terrible Adamantium bullet?\n\nLet’s find out which of these is the best as we pit Beskar, Vibranium and Adamantium against each other!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/CBR\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ComicBookRes...\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@cbrvideo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/comi...\n\nOur Website\nhttps://www.cbr.com\n\nWritten by: Jordan Phillips\nEdited by: Chris Chan Roberson\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com\n\n00:00 Start\n00:25 Beskar\n04:43 Vibranium\n08:10 Adamantium\n11:14 Winner",

          'Which Jedi Will Visit GROGU on TYTHON? - (All Living Jedi During Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 5)',
        description:
          "After meeting with Ahsoka Tano on the charred forest world of Corvus in hopes of having Grogu Trained as a Jedi sorcerer, \n\nAfter meeting with Din Djarin and Grogu on the charred, forest world of Corvus, and being unable to train Grogu because of his deep attachment to his father figure, Ahsoka Tano directed Mando him to bring Grogu to the ancient world of Tython, where a Jedi Knight may be able to find him. But who will this Jedi be?  I’m going to break down every single Jedi that is alive during the time of the Mandalorian, and which are the most likely to meet Grogu on Tython.\n\nSo before we get into it, make sure to smash the subscribe button for more awesome Star Wars Lore content.\n\nTython is an ancient Jedi world, which is said to be one of the potential origin planets of the Jedi Order, along with Jedha, Ossus and Coruscant, where a group of force sensitive settlers known as the Tythans went through many evolutions and changes in belief, until they eventually morphed into the modern Jedi Order of the Republic. \n\nThe reason these original settlers came to Tython was because of it’s immense connection to the force, and because it served as a vast land of opportunity for all force users to live together and harness their potential in the force.\n\nIt’s because of this incredible connection to the force, that placing Grogu onto a seeing stone on one of the nine Jedi temples will likely alert surviving Jedi to his presence, possibly summoning to him.\n\nBut which Jedi will come?\n\nSo the first potential Jedi that could visit tython is of course Ezra Bridger. In the final moments of the Battle of Lothal, from Star Wars: Rebels. Ezra Bridger bravely sacrificed himself in order to stop Grand Admiral Thrawn and his fleet from destroying his homeworld of Lotha, by signalling for Pergil, a species of space creatures who have the natural ability to enter hyperspace, and guiding them through the force to wrap around Grand Admiral Thrawn's flagship, the Chimaera, before sending them deep into the unknown regions. \n\n\nBased on what we know so far, it’s not clear that Ezra has even been found yed by Ahsoka Tano and Sabine, who set out to search for him after his brave actions. Dave Filloni himself also stated, right after the Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 5 aired, “it’s possible that the story I’m telling The Mandalorian actually takes place prior to that. Possible. I’m saying it’s possible. \n\nThis is of course a very vague and cryptic response, which is standard for Dave, but it’s pretty likely that most of the future story is already written, so I don’t think he would mention this at all if this episode of the Mandalorian wasn’t before the Rebel’s epilogue.  For this reason, I’m leaning towards Ezra not showing up on Tython, but I really hope that he does and that Dave is just misdirecting us! But Let me know what you think down below.\n\nAfter that we of course have the man that everyone wants to see, Luke Skywalker.\nFollowing the fall of the Empire, with the defeat of Emperor Palpatine, and the redemption of his father, Darth Vader, Luke set out to re-establish the Jedi order and restore peace and Justice to the Galaxy once more. In his quest to do this, Luke travelled the Galaxy, searching for ancient Jedi artifacts, texts, and any piece of history that would aid him in his goal of rebuilding the Jedi. In Star Wars: Legends, Tython is the birthplace of the Jedi order, and contained many,, many years of rich Jedi history, inside their 9 great temples and the various Je’Daii buildings and ruins. If you want to know the full history of how the Jedi Order was formed from a group of force sensitive settlers, make sure to check the link in the pinned comment down below after you finish this video, it's a really awesome story.  Because Tython’s rich history and connection to the Jedi Order, the would be a perfect place for Luke Skywalker visit while trying to rebuild his new Order, and discover everything he can about them. For this reason, he is probably very aware of Tython’s existence, and it’s seeing stone, possibly meaning he is awaiting it’s use, so that he can recruit new force users into his Jedi Order. If Luke does show up on Tython however, I’d probably expect it to be a season finale reveal, as a teaser for Season 3\n\nAlongside Luke Skywalker, is of course his sister Leia. Now I really don’t think the Jedi on Tython will be Leia, \nFollowing this is Cere Junda and her apprentice Cal Kestis. After successfully recovering a holocron containing the names of many force sensitive children in the Galaxy, Cal and his master chose to destroy it to prevent it falling into the hands of the Empire. With Cere Junda being around her 70s during the time of the Mandalorian, I don’t see her making an appearance on Tython unless she discovered it and settled down on the force rich planet later down the line. Instead, there’s a good chance that we see Cal Kestis make his first live action appearance.",
